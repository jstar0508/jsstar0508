### 💡 I build scalable backend systems and integrate AI into real-world products.

If you need:

* A reliable backend (Spring Boot, Node, Python)
* AI integrated into your product (OpenAI, LLMs, embeddings, RAG)
* Automation that saves hours of manual work
* ML-powered APIs deployed with Docker

You're in the right place.
